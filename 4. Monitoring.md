# Monitoring
#What is SIEM?
SIEM combines two key functions: Security Information Management (SIM) and Security Event Management (SEM). This integration allows organizations to collect, analyze, and manage security data from various sources. The primary features of SIEM include:
*  Log Collection: SIEM systems gather log data from different devices and applications within an organization.
*  Event Correlation: They analyze the collected data to identify patterns that may indicate security threats.
*  Real-Time Monitoring: SIEM provides continuous monitoring of security events to detect anomalies as they occur.
*  Threat Detection and Response: Detects potential threats in real-time and responds based on predefined rules.
*  Compliance Reporting: Generates reports to help meet regulatory requirements.
*  Incident Response: The system can trigger alerts and automate responses to potential threats, helping to mitigate risks quickly.
## Extra SIEM Market (2024)
*  Cisco completed its acquisition of Splunk for $28 billion, a move that consolidates its position in the SIEM market
*  Palo Alto Networks acquired IBM's QRadar SaaS for $500 million, indicating a strategic shift towards cloud-based solutions
*  Many vendors are integrating Generative AI capabilities into their SIEM offerings. For instance, CrowdStrike launched its Falcon Next-Gen SIEM, enhancing it with AI-driven functionalities for better threat detection and response.
*  SIEM tools are increasingly emphasizing compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, providing built-in reporting features to help organizations meet these requirements.
*  Advanced analytics capabilities are becoming standard, allowing organizations to detect sophisticated threats such as advanced persistent threats (APTs) more effectively.
*  Analysts predict ongoing consolidation in the SIEM market as companies strive to enhance their security analytics platforms amid competition from cloud giants like Microsoft and Google Cloud.
